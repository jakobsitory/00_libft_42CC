# **Libft**
The **Libft** project is one of the first and most critical projects at 42 School. As a foundational project, it sets the stage for many future projects by ensuring that students have a strong grasp of the basics of C programming. The project requires building a static library from scratch, which includes re-implementing a subset of the standard C library functions and additional custom functions that are commonly used in software development.
This project is designed to reinforce knowledge of C programming, memory management, and function implementation.

## **Task**
The main task was to implement a series of standard C library functions, as well as additional functions to provide enhanced functionality that would be used throughout future projects. The functions covered various aspects such as string manipulation, memory management, linked lists, and more.

**Key objectives included:**
- Re-implementing functions such as `strlen`, `strcpy`, `memset`, `malloc`, and others.
- Creating additional utility functions like `ft_split`, `ft_itoa`, and linked list manipulation functions.
- Writing clean, efficient, and well-documented code to ensure readability and maintainability.

 ## **Key Achievements:**
- Gained a strong foundation in C programming and memory management.
- Developed a reusable library that can be used in subsequent projects.
- Improved problem-solving skills and attention to detail through the meticulous implementation and testing of each function.

## **Installation**
To install the Project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: **`git clone git@github.com:jakobsitory/00_libft_42CC.git`**
2. Navigate to the project directory: **`00_libft_42CC`**
4. Build the project: **`make`**

## **Usage**
1. Install francinette to test all of the function: **'https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette"**
2. Open project directory and run **'francinette'** to run extensive tests on the finctions
